Binary Calculator
====

This [Origami Studio](https://origami.design) project models a 4-bit ripple-carry [adder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)). 

To build the adder, I created custom patches for Exclusive Or, Half Adder, and Full Adder. There's also a patch for converting a 5-bit number to decimal. You can add these patches to Origami Studio by opening **Binary Calculator Kit.origami-system**.
