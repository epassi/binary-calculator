Binary Calculator

This Origami project models a 4-bit ripple-carry [adder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)).

### Binary Calculator Kit

To build the adder, I created custom patches for Exclusive Or, Half Adder, Full Adder. There's also a patch for converting a 5-bit number to decimal. You can add these patches to Origami Studio by opening **Binary Calculator Kit.origami-system**.
